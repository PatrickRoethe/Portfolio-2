    reflection: `At the time of this portfolio, I haven’t yet implemented all the improvements I originally intended. Due to personal circumstances, I’ve been slightly behind, but I’ve learned the importance of structured work, planning, and consistency. I plan to spend the summer not only improving this project but also creating new ones to push myself further as a developer.

One key insight is how much more enjoyable coding becomes the more you do it. My goal is to make development a daily habit, and to keep improving — both in terms of design, functionality, and professional workflow. These are lessons I’ve learned throughout my studies, and this project is part of a longer journey toward becoming a better frontend developer.

Through my time at Noroff, and by creating a plan based on the curriculum, I feel confident that I now have the tools to move forward. The exam projects serve as strong foundations and reference points that I will continue to build upon as I gain more experience and confidence.`,
